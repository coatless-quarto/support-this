A Quarto extension to add crowdfunding and sponsorship links to your Quarto documents to support your content creation.

## Installation

To install the `support-this` Quarto extension, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Execute the following command:

```sh
quarto add coatless-quarto/support-this
```

This command will download and install the Quarto extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory of your Quarto project. If you are using version control, ensure that you include this directory in your repository.

## Usage

In order to use the `support-this` extension, you need to configure it in your Quarto document's YAML front matter.

First, add the `support-this` filter to the `filters` list.

```yaml
filters: [support-this]
```

Next, provide your funding platform usernames or URLs under the `support-this`'s `extensions` section. Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post"
format:
  html: default
  typst: default
extensions:
  support-this:
    heading: "Support This Project"  # Optional custom title
    message: "Your support helps keep this project alive!"  # Optional message
    github: username
    patreon: username
    ko_fi: username
    buy_me_a_coffee: username
    custom: "https://paypal.me/username"
    use_funding_yml: false  # Set to true to use GitHub FUNDING.yml if available
filters: [support-this]
---
```

where `username` should be replaced with your actual usernames on the respective platforms.

## Supported Platforms

The following platforms are supported. Use the corresponding key followed by your username or URL:

- GitHub Sponsors: `github: username`
- Patreon: `patreon: username`
- Ko-fi: `ko_fi: username`
- Buy Me a Coffee: `buy_me_a_coffee: username`
- Liberapay: `liberapay: username`
- Open Collective: `open_collective: username`
- IssueHunt: `issuehunt: username`
- LFX Mentorship: `community_bridge: projectname`
- Tidelift: `tidelift: platform/package` (e.g., `npm/my-package`)
- Polar: `polar: username`
- thanks.dev: `thanks_dev: u/gh/username`
- Custom URLs: `custom: url` or `custom: [url1, url2]`

## Multiple Accounts

You can specify multiple accounts for any platform:

```yaml
extensions:
  support-this:
    github: [user1, user2, user3]
    custom: 
      - "https://paypal.me/username"
      - "https://venmo.com/username"
```

Each account will be displayed as a separate link.

## Configuration Options

The `support-this` extension supports the following configuration options:

- `heading`: Custom title for the support section (default: "Support This Work")
- `message`: Custom message to display above the links
- `truncated`: If true, shows only icons without text labels (default: false)
- `use_funding_yml`: If true, attempts to read GitHub's FUNDING.yml for funding links (default: false)

## Funding.yml Support

If `use_funding_yml` is set to true, the extension will attempt to read the `FUNDING.yml` file
from the root of your Quarto project to populate funding links automatically.
