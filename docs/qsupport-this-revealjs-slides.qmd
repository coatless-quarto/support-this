## Introduction

This is a RevealJS presentation testing the support-this extension.

## Support-This Integration

When rendered as a RevealJS presentation, the extension automatically:

1. Detects RevealJS format
2. Creates a non-titled slide (e.g. empty `##`)
3. Adds support links
4. Places at end of presentation (can be configured)

## Example Configuration

```yaml
extensions:
  support-this:
    platforms:
      github: username
      patreon: username
```

This is just a demo slide.
