This document demonstrates how to configure the `support-this` Quarto extension
with multiple custom links and multiple GitHub usernames directly in the
document's YAML front matter.

## Configuration

The configuration specified in the YAML front matter is as follows:

```yaml
extensions:
  support-this:
    heading: "Support My Work"
    platforms:
      github: [coatless, yourusername]
      custom:
        - "https://paypal.me/yourusername"
        - "https://yourwebsite.com/donate"
``` 

You may use either a single string or a list of strings for the `github` and `custom`
fields to include multiple usernames or links.

When you render this document, you should see support buttons for both GitHub Sponsors
accounts (`coatless` and `yourusername`), as well as buttons for the custom links
provided (PayPal and your personal donation page). Fields with multiple entries will
display separate buttons for each entry.
