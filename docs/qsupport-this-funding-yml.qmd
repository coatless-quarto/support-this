## Using FUNDING.yml

This document demonstrates how to use a `FUNDING.yml` file to configure the `support-this` extension in Quarto. 
The extension will read the funding information from the `FUNDING.yml` file located in the same directory
as this document. We have specified the `use_funding_yml: true` option in the extension configuration to
enable this feature.

```yaml
title: "Funding YAML Example"
format: html
extensions:
    support-this:
        heading: "Support My Work (Based on FUNDING.yml)"
        use_funding_yml: true
```

### FUNDING.yml Structure

The `FUNDING.yml` file can include multiple platforms and custom links, allowing you to easily manage your
funding options in one place. For more details on the format of the `FUNDING.yml` file, refer to the 
[GitHub documentation on funding files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository).

Here is the content of the `FUNDING.yml` file used in this example:

```yaml
github: [coatless, octocat]
patreon: coatless
custom: ["https://www.paypal.me/coatless", thecoatlessprofessor.com]
```
